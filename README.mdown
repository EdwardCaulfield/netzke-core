# netzke-core
Create Ext JS + Rails reusable components (widgets) with minimum effort.

Note that if you would like to modify this code or experiment with it, you may be better off cloning this project into your app's vendor/plugin directory - it will then behave as a Rails plugin.

# Example

See the tutorials on http://blog.writelesscode.com
